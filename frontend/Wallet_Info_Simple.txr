Wallets — Simple English Summary (from the Earning Wallet screen)

What this page is about
- Shows your total earnings, how much you can actually withdraw, your reward points, and when/how you can request a withdrawal.
- Also shows whether your Prime (150/750) and Monthly plans are active, and your progress toward the “auto ₹1000” rule.

Main balances you will see
1) Income Wallet
   - Your total earnings before any deductions (gross).
   - Grows from commissions like: Direct Refer, Matrix Income, Franchise/Geo income, Global incomes, etc.
   - Label on screen: “Income Wallet”.

2) Withdrawable Wallet
   - The money you can actually send to your bank (net).
   - Mainly grows through the “auto ₹1000” rule (explained below).
   - Card shows: “Net to Withdraw per ₹1000 block” so you know how much you will receive each time a block completes.

Taxes (10% TDS idea)
- A simple 10% tax idea is used for commissions. This is considered when earnings are added, so you are not taxed again at withdrawal.
- Some numbers on the page also show a simple 10% preview to help you understand the net.

Auto ₹1000 rule (how withdrawable money is formed)
- For every full ₹1000 earned in your Income Wallet, one block is applied:
  - ₹150 tries to give you one self e‑coupon (if stock is available).
  - ₹50 goes to company (maintenance/tax).
  - ₹50 goes to your direct sponsor (thank‑you bonus).
  - The rest (₹1000 − ₹150 − ₹50 − ₹50 = ₹750) is added to your Withdrawable Wallet.
- The page displays:
  - How much of the current ₹1000 block is completed,
  - How much is left to complete it,
  - How many blocks have been applied and how many are pending,
  - A line explaining the per‑block breakdown and your “Net to Withdraw”.
- In short: every ₹1000 gross earned becomes ₹750 withdrawable (plus the coupon and two ₹50 splits).

Prime and Monthly status
- Shows if your Prime packages (like 150 or 750) are Active/Inactive and the date of activation.
- Shows if your Monthly plan is Active/Inactive and its activation date.

Reward Points
- Total Reward Points: the full points you have.
- “Reward Redeemed Points” on the card: a simple view of points considered spent compared to your total earnings.
- Points can be used on selected items where points are allowed.

Your incomes shown on the cards (for quick understanding)
- Today Earning: How much you earned today.
- Direct Refer Commission: Money from people directly referred by you.
- Matrix Level Income: Money from your team’s matrix levels.

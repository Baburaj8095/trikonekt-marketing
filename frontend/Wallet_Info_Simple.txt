Wallets — Simple English Summary (from the Earning Wallet screen)

What this page is about
- This screen shows everything related to your earnings, your withdrawable money, your rewards, and the rules for making a withdrawal.
- It also shows your Prime/Monthly status and the progress of the “auto ₹1000” rule.

Main balances you will see
1) Income Wallet
   - This is your total earnings before tax (gross).
   - It grows when you get commissions like direct refer, matrix income, franchise/geo income, etc.
   - The number is shown as: ₹ [Income Wallet].

2) Withdrawable Wallet
   - This is the part you can actually take out to your bank (net).
   - It mainly grows through the “auto ₹1000” rule described below.
   - The page shows “Net to Withdraw per ₹1000 block” so you know how much you will get when the block completes.

Taxes (10% TDS idea)
- The system uses a 10% tax idea for commissions. This is already considered when earnings are credited, so you don’t get taxed again at withdrawal.
- On the page, some previews also assume 10% tax for quick understanding.

Auto ₹1000 rule (how your withdrawable grows)
- For every full ₹1000 you earn in your Income Wallet, one block is applied:
  - ₹150 tries to buy you one self e‑coupon (if stock is available).
  - ₹50 goes to company (tax/maintenance).
  - ₹50 goes to your direct sponsor as a bonus.
  - The balance (₹1000 − ₹150 − ₹50 − ₹50 = ₹750) is added to your Withdrawable Wallet.
- The page shows:
  - How much of the current ₹1000 block is completed,
  - How much is remaining,
  - How many blocks are applied, and how many are pending,
  - The per‑block breakdown and your “Net to Withdraw”.

Prime and Monthly status
- The page tells you if your Prime packages are active (like 150/750) and whether the Monthly package is active.
- It also shows the date when they got activated.

Reward Points
- You see your total Reward Points.
- “Reward Redeemed Points” shows how many points are considered spent compared to your total earnings.
- Points can be used on selected items where points are allowed.

Helpful progress and limits shown

- A progress bar shows how close you are to completing the current block.

Other quick notes
- The page also keeps track of your past withdrawal requests this week. If you already requested in this Sunday window, you cannot request again in the same window.
- The page regularly refreshes the Sunday window timer (so it opens and closes at the right time).

- Withdrawable Wallet = Net money you can take out (mainly grows every time a ₹1000 block completes).

- KYC = Your bank/KYC details must be verified before you can withdraw.
- Sunday window = You can request a withdrawal only on Sunday 6:00 PM–11:59 PM, once per Sunday.

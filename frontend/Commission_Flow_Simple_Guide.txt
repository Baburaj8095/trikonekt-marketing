Commission & Rewards Flow — Simple English Guide

Purpose
This note explains, in plain language, how money and points are shared in the system. It covers:
- TDS/Company deduction (10%)
- Direct sponsor and upline sharing
- Local agency (geo) sharing
- Auto ₹1000 rule
- Withdrawals and the sponsor bonus on withdrawals
- Fixed direct/level amounts on join/activation
- Reward Points (team milestones)
- Matrix (3‑wide and 5‑wide) placement and earnings
- Who can change the numbers
No technical terms are used; only how it works for people involved.


1) When money is added to someone’s wallet (a “commission”)
- This happens after activities like coupon approvals, auto‑pool/matrix earnings, level bonuses, franchise/geo earnings, etc.
- Whenever such a commission is given to a person, two things occur:
  a) A small part is kept aside for the company as TDS/Tax (10% by default).
  b) The rest becomes available for that person to withdraw.


2) The 10% TDS / Company deduction
- From every commission payment, 10% goes to the company’s pool as tax (by default).
- The remaining 90% is the person’s “take‑home” amount that they can withdraw.
- The company can change this 10% number whenever needed.


3) Sharing to your sponsor and your higher levels (upline)
- The system can also share a small percentage of a commission with people above you.
- There are five levels above you called L1 to L5.
  Typical default sharing from a commission (example values):
  - L1: 2%
  - L2: 1%
  - L3: 1%
  - L4: 0.5%
  - L5: 0.5%
- These numbers can be changed by the company at any time.


4) Sharing to local agency roles (geo sharing)
- A part of a commission can also be shared with agency roles based on where the earning person lives (their pincode/state).
- The roles are:
  - Sub‑Franchise (at pincode)
  - Pincode
  - Pincode Coordinator
  - District
  - District Coordinator
  - State
  - State Coordinator
  - Employee (closest relevant employee)
  - Royalty (company/owner side)
- Typical default ideas (company can change them):
  - Sub‑Franchise ~15%
  - Pincode ~4%
  - Pincode Coord ~2%
  - District ~1%
  - District Coord ~1%
  - State ~1%
  - State Coord ~1%
  - Employee ~2%
  - Royalty ~10%
- If a role is not available for a location, that share is simply skipped.


5) Auto ₹1000 rule (happens automatically as you earn)
- As your total earnings grow, for every full ₹1000 collected in your wallet’s main balance, one “auto pack” is applied:
  - The system tries to give you one ₹150 e‑coupon for yourself (if stock is available).
  - The company receives ₹50 (tax/maintenance).
  - Your direct sponsor receives ₹50 as a thank‑you.
  - You get the remaining ₹750 added to the amount you can withdraw.
- If the ₹150 coupon is not available at that moment, the system still does the other parts.
- This rule repeats for every full ₹1000 you earn (₹2000 = two packs, and so on).


6) Direct referral on join/activation (fixed rupee amounts)
- When someone joins/activates under you, the system can give fixed rupee amounts to you (Direct) and your upline levels.
- Typical defaults:
  - Direct: ₹15
  - L1: ₹2
  - L2: ₹1
  - L3: ₹1
  - L4: ₹0.5
  - L5: ₹0.5
- These are not percentages; they are fixed rupees. The company can change these anytime.


7) Withdrawals (when you take money out)
- You request a withdrawal of your available amount.
- After approval, that amount is paid to you.
- Additionally, your direct sponsor gets a small “lifetime” bonus on your withdrawal (default 3% of what you withdrew).
- No extra tax is cut at withdrawal time because the tax was already taken when you originally earned the commissions.


8) Reward Points (team milestones)
- Apart from money, the system also gives Reward Points when your team reaches certain coupon milestones.
- Example default rewards (company can change these):
  - After 1 coupon: 1,000 points
  - After 2 coupons: 10,000 points
  - After 3 coupons: 30,000 points
  - After 4 coupons: 60,000 points
  - After 5 coupons: 110,000 points
  - After that, every extra coupon: 20,000 points each
- These points can be used on selected products/services where points are allowed.


9) Matrix (3‑wide and 5‑wide)
- The system builds two kinds of team trees for consumers:
  - 3‑wide matrix (up to many levels)
  - 5‑wide matrix (up to 6 levels by default)
- New accounts for you first try to sit under your own existing matrix branch (to keep your cluster together).
- If that is not possible, they sit under your upline’s open spot.
- Earnings from these matrix placements flow as commissions, and then the normal sharing and 10% tax rule apply.
- The company can set:
  - How many levels the matrix pays
  - Either fixed rupee amounts per level or percentages per level


10) Company pool and transparency
- The company pool (the 10% TDS part) is recorded clearly.
- From time to time, the company may distribute that pool internally or keep it for operations.
- All people’s earnings and the company pool entries are recorded so they can be reviewed.


11) Who can change the numbers
- The company can change:
  - The 10% tax/TDS number and the company user who receives it
  - The sponsor/upline (L1..L5) percentages
  - The geo/agency percentages
  - The fixed rupee amounts for direct and levels on join/activation
  - Reward Points milestones and “points per extra coupon”
  - Matrix level counts and per‑level payouts
- If the company changes values, new earnings use the new values going forward.


12) Quick examples

A. Example commission of ₹100 to a person
- 10% to company = ₹10
- Person’s available to withdraw ≈ ₹90
- If this commission also includes sharing to upline/agency roles, those people get their parts too (and each of them also has 10% deducted from their own share). The system does this automatically.

B. Example withdrawal of ₹1,000 by you
- You receive ₹1,000 (assuming you had that much available).
- Your direct sponsor gets 3% of ₹1,000 = ₹30 as a lifetime withdrawal bonus.

C. Example auto ₹1000 rule
- When you cross ₹1,000 earned:
  - One ₹150 coupon for you (if in stock),
  - ₹50 to company,
  - ₹50 to your sponsor,
  - ₹750 gets added to your withdrawable amount.

Important notes
- Percentages and fixed rupee amounts shown here are typical defaults. The company can update them whenever needed.
- If a particular role (like “Pincode Coordinator”) does not exist for your area, that role’s share is simply skipped.
- Withdrawals do not cut extra tax because the tax was already deducted when you earned the commission.
